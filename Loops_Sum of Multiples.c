/*Given a positive integer n, find the sum of all integers from 1 to n (inclusive) that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7.

You must print the result, not return it.

Input Format

A single integer input: n

Constraints

1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 10^3
Output Format

Print a single integer — the sum of all numbers in the given range divisible by 3, 5, or 7

Sample Input 0

7
Sample Output 0

21
Explanation 0

Numbers in the range [1, 7] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7.
The sum of these numbers is 21
